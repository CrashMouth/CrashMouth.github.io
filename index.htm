					<h4>Summary of Concept</h4>
					<div id="content"><p>CrashMouth, the newest innovation in athletic biometric technology, will offer real-time data on several athletic diagnostics – from dehydration levels to force of impact. Our primary strategy is to develop CrashMouth as the most versatile and cost-effective athletic diagnostic system on the market – making athletes from all walks of life safer and more efficient in play. </p>
					<p>Once started up, CrashMouth will cater to numerous sports – focusing mainly on those that have high concussion rates. Basketball, soccer, and, most importantly, football, will be some of the many contenders that could take advantage of our product’s concussion sensor. While the additional biometrics and lightweight design will make it usable, even in casual play. Within the next ten years, we intend for CrashMouth to expand to most, if not all, professional leagues – taking the international stage in athletic safety. </p>

					<h4>Company and Management</h4>
					<div id="content">
					<p>CrashMouth headquarters will be in Marion County, a location known for its fantastic high school athletic programs. The owners of the company – Gregory Han, Olivia Hensel, Zachary Thomsson, and Brian Epstein – come from various walks of high school life that make them experienced in catering to teenage athletes. </p>
					<p>As for employment strategies, Marion County’s diverse corporate office base makes outsourcing manufacturing an ideal strategy for CrashMouth. However, during spikes in demand, younger, part-time employees will also be hired. By inciting these employees with product discounts, we can further increase customer loyalty in our student athlete consumer base, while simultaneously getting return on the increased cost of wages. </p>

					<h4>Opportunites and Stratagies</h4>
					<div id="content">
					<p>Although Marion County is not home to any professional sports leagues, it does, as aforesaid, have something of comparable value in high school athletic programs. As the epicenter for high school football giants like Vanguard and soccer giants like Forest, CrashMouth would certainly be in an ideal starting ground. With such a lack of professional medical personnel on high school fields, coupled with the high-intensity play that these high schools engage in on the day-to-day, demand for our services will be ample enough to continue growing at a steady rate.</p>
					<p>This, however, begs the question of competition. To combat this, CrashMouth is the first to combine these medical systems into one product, making it extraordinarily versatile. Not to mention that pricing will range from $250-$300 – a whole $150 below the competition.</p>
